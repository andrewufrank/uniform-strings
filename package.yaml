synopsis: Manipulate and convert strings of characters uniformly and consistently
description: |
    Reduce complexity of Haskell by providing a 

    - set of uniformly named conversion functions between 

        - String, 
    
        - Text, 
    
        - ByteString, 
    
        - LazyByteString and 
    
        - urlEncoding
    
    with the most important text manipulation functions for string and text
    where the semantic is the same (tested with quickcheck).
    Tentatively some infix string manipulations are offered as well. 
    
      - 0.1.3 added stack build lts 19.16 for ghc 9.0.2
      - 0.1.3.1 removed dependency on text-icu
