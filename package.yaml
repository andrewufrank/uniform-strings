synopsis: Manipulate and convert strings of characters uniformly and consistently
description: |
    Reduce complexity of Haskell by providing a 

    - set of uniformly named conversion functions between 

        - String, 
    
        - Text, 
    
        - ByteString, 
    
        - LazyByteString and 
    
        - urlEncoding
    
    with the most important text manipulation functions for string and text
    where the semantic is the same (tested with quickcheck).
    Tentatively some infix string manipulations are offered as well. 
    
    Please see the README on GitHub at <https://github.com/andrewufrank/uniform-strings/readme>
